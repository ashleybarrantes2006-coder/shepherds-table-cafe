**Client & Purpose**
The Shepherd’s Table Cafe is a Christian community hub designed to blend faith, fellowship, and farm-fresh dining. The site serves as a digital "welcome mat" for the neighborhood, allowing visitors to:
  -Explore our farm-to-table menu ("The Cellar," "The Sea," and "The Harvest").
  -Learn about community events like Prayer Circles and Neighborhood Gatherings.
  -Book reservations through an interactive online form.

**Design Evolutions**
Since Assignment 1, I made a significant pivot in the design process:
  -Fresh Start: Unfortunately, my original Figma design file was lost. I decided to view this as an opportunity for a fresh start rather than a setback.
  -The Change: I redesigned the Homepage from scratch. This allowed me to create a cleaner, more modern layout with a stronger focus on Semantic HTML and a more intuitive Flexbox grid for the "Offerings" and "Community" sections. The result is a more polished and responsive user experience than the original concept.

AI Usage Documentation
I used AI as a collaborative coding partner during the development of this site in the following ways:
  -Explaining Concepts & Syntax: AI helped me understand how to structure complex sections, such as using <article> tags for SEO and how justify-content: space-between works in the navigation bar.
  -Debugging Errors: When my CSS layout didn't align correctly or image paths were broken, I used AI to identify the "bugs" and provide the correct syntax to fix them.
  -Refining Language: AI helped translate technical coding concepts into simpler language to ensure my code was well-documented and easy to follow.
