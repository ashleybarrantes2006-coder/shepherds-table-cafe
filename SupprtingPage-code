                <div class="story-text-box">
                    <p>The Shepherd's Table Cafe was born from a simple prayer and a profound calling. In 2020, our founder, Sarah Mitchell, felt called to create a space where the neighborhood could gather not just for food, but for fellowship and faith.</p>
                    <p>What started as a small community kitchen quickly blossomed into a full cafe and gathering space. Partnering with local farmers—including the Henderson family's sheep farm just outside town—we committed to serving meals that honor both the land and the hands that tend it.</p>
                    <p>Today, The Shepherd's Table is more than a restaurant. It's a home where young professionals find peace after long workdays, where families create memories over Sunday brunch, and where the elderly find companionship and warmth.</p>
